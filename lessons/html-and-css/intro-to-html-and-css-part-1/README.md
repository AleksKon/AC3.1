#Lecture
##What is HTML?
At its simplest a web page can just be plain text, just like you would type into a text editor. However, that’s pretty boring… The true power of the web comes from being able to easily link web pages together in a structured format. 

**Discussion** What’s the importance of having a standardized structure for web pages? What types of elements (e.g. headers, paragraphs) do we see repeatedly across different web pages?
