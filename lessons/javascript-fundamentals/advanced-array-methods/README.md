#Lecture
##Intro to advanced array methods
Array methods are a really powerful tool in JavaScript. Specifically, methods like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` make solving certain problems (for example, a lot of problems that we've previously been using loops to solve) a lot easier. Let's learn how they work!

###Demo: Advanced array methods
- `every`
- `sort` 
- `reverse`
