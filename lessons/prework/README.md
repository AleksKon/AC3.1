# Unit 0: Prework

Congratulations on getting accepted to Access Code! Please complete the following two assignments:

1. **Get to level 7 on CodeWars:**

CodeWars is a website with a big collection of challenge problems, organized by difficulty and topic. It's an awesome resource for honing your skills and becoming a better developer!

CodeWars ranks questions by different levels (aka 'kyu'). Rankings range from level 8 to level 1, with level 8 (aka '8 kyu') being the easiest, and level 1 (aka '1 kyu') being the hardest. 

The more questions you answer the more your ranking improves. You'll start out at 8 kyu and as you answer questions your kyu level will gradually go down. 1 kyu is the best (but very difficult to achieve), so the lower your ranking the better! 

Your goal is to improve from an 8 kyu ranking to 7 kyu ranking. You'll have to answer roughly 8-10 of the following problems correctly in order to achieve a 7 kyu ranking.

To get started signup for a CodeWars account then start solving questions!
